# The Generator

The user has the option to randomly generate text and images that are collected via an API server to then find the key points of the image or they can specificly upload an image that will be cropped and text can be adjusted as well. All images' keypoints are found through the ORB algorithm, and a circle is drawn around the densest area of keypoints to highlight a main section of the image, unto which then and arrow will be drawn around, further reflecting the common social media approach to publicity known as, "Clickbait".
